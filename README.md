#SAFe App Tools
=========================

## Getting Started

You can build by running the following commands:

```
npm install -g bower
npm install
bower install
```

Then you can use rally-app-builder to run the application on a local server:

```
rally-app-builder build
rally-app-builder run
```

## Known Usage Issues

The current angular-safe-tools implementation depends on Rally internal UI components that have not been made publicly available yet. Therefore, you can only use this if you are on the Rally network.
